# SPY_WeekdayAnalysis
Analysis on SPY prices based on the specific weekday.
Data is pulled from Yahoo Finance using python package YFinance.
(Partially relies on Pandas and DfPly which is a python package based on R's Dplyr - https://github.com/kieferk/dfply#n)

Program can be run with any dates on any ticker with information on Yahoo Finance.

This was really more of an Ad Hoc question I was curious about - and the project evolved from there.
