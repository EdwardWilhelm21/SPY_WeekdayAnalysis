# SPY_WeekdayAnalysis
Analysis on SPY prices based on the specific weekday.
Data is pulled from Yahoo Finance using python package YFinance.
(Heavily relies on Pandas and DfPly which is a python package based on R's Dplyr - https://github.com/kieferk/dfply#n)

Program can be run with any dates on any ticker with information on Yahoo Finance.
I used 01-01-2022 and SPY for this example.

This was really more of an Ad Hoc question I was curious about. What days of the week are most often Green?
Also looked at the returns if you had day traded from open to close on specific weekdays for the given timeframe.
Would be fun to test this against other factors and look at correlation metrics.

DfPly is really fun to use, I was glad I got to use Pandas plotting a bit as well - those graphs could be prettier.
